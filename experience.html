<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>My Experience</b></h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">Before i continue my study in UiTm, im taking part time job as a part time sale assistant at health and beauty company named Guardian in KLIA2 about 9 month since i graduating from my high school and waiting for diploma intake.since i love to taking care of my beauty such as using makeup and skin care, working there was one of the greatest work experience that i have. I really love to communicate with customers and since I work at the departure level, I have met many people from different countries. It is also something new to me because I can learn and communicate with my customers.</p>
